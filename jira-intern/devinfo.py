"""Jira Development-Information client — branches, pull requests and review state.

This reads Jira's dev-status API, the same source that renders the "Development"
panel on a Jira issue. Bitbucket indexes every commit and branch against the ticket
keys it mentions and pushes that to Jira, so one call per issue returns work in ANY
repository — including repos this tool has never been told about.

That matters most for sub-tasks: a master ticket is usually delivered through
sub-tasks that several people own, and their branches often live in infrastructure
or pipeline repos far away from the team's main application repo.

Bitbucket is still called, but only to enrich a pull request that is still open
(reviewer NEEDS_WORK flags and unresolved comment counts, which dev-status omits).
Those calls address the PR by its exact project/repo/id taken from the dev-status
URL, so there is no repo guessing anywhere in this module.
