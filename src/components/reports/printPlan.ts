// Pagination for the PDF slide deck. Pure, so it is unit-tested; every height comes from the DOM
// (PrReportPrint measures the real blocks at slide width before it lays the deck out).
//
// The rules, in order:
//   1. A block is either an ATOM (a callout, a KPI strip, a two-column composite) that never splits,
//      or a run of ITEMS (table rows, card rows, list entries) that may split between items only.
//      A split block repeats its head (heading + table header) on every slide it spans.
//   2. A block's head is never left alone at the foot of a slide: it moves on with its first item.
//   3. A composite taller than one slide is replaced by its fallback blocks, which can split.
//   4. When a block spills onto a last slide that would be nearly empty, rows are moved back so the
//      two slides carry similar amounts — never one stray row on a slide of its own.
//   5. Sections that fit on one slide each and fit together are merged onto one slide, so a short
//      report is not a run of near-empty slides.
//   6. An atom taller than a slide still gets one slide; the fit pass shrinks it (see printFit).
