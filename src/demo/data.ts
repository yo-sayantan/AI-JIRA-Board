// Loads the Demo-mode sample board from `jira-intern/demo/data.json`.
//
// That folder is the source of truth — it sits beside the real dump so the sample tickets can be
// read, and edited, by hand (see its README). This module only does two things: compile a copy
// into the bundle so Demo mode also works from `file://`, and re-date it on load.
//
// Re-dating: the file stores real timestamps anchored to `_demoNow`. Every date is shifted by the
// gap between that anchor and the current time, so the sample board always looks as if it were
// fetched minutes ago — the active sprint is still active, Next Sprint still has not started, and
// the Done card that "archives in 1d" still does.
